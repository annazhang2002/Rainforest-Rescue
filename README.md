Rainforest Rescue 
==================

## Game Description

Rainforest Rescue is a game designed to educate people about the threats tropical rainforests are facing. Each level is a series of obstacles for the user to dodge to reach the finish line. 

## Background Information

After studying abroad in Costa Rica to learn about biodiversity and conservation, I wanted to create a project that helps educate people about the causes that are destroying the beautiful rainforests. 

In the summer of 2017, I attended the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes and took a course entitled Computer Simulations and Interactive Media. We learned how to code a Pico-8 game using Lua, and it was one of my first object-oriented programming projects and the first game I ever coded. 

## Project Demo

Here are some simple examples of how the game is played, but if you are interested in playing the game yourself, I have uploaded it to the splore page here : [Rainforest Rescue](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=30130)

## Game Features

- Rainforest Threatening Obstacles: Each of the obstacles in the game is a real-life threat to the rainforest as described below
  - Climate Change: One of the biggest threats is climate change, caused by increasing CO2 emissions that heat the planet. Thus, in the game, there are little CO2 clouds everywhere that the player must dodge.
  - Forest Fires: Obviously forest fires can destroy the rainforests and harm all of the creatures that depend on this habitat
  - Urban Sprawl / Habitat Fragmentation: Many industries are destroying the forests for urban development, and in the game I represent this threat with the building that are replacing forests. 
  - Invasive Species: Other birds and animals that are not native to the land can endangered species like quetzals and toucans.

- Endangered Bird Sprites: To highlight the endangered species in the rainforest, I created two player sprite options that can be selected in the store including the quetzal and the toucan. Because the quetzals eat avocados in the rainforest, the currency is avocados instead of coins.

#### Hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it!
